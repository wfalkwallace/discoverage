# Discoverage
Discoverage is a game where players discover, feed, and train cute monsters in their city. Monsters are discovered at random, at different geographic locations. They need to be taken care of and fed with bananas, which grow around the city. Bananas become depleted in areas where the user often spends time, and gathering bananas to keep their monsters happy incentivizes them visiting other neighborhoods. Different monsters occur in different cities, incentivizing users to try the app in different places.

### Banana Map

The map shows where there are bananas in the local area. The user can then go and pick them up. Bananas take a while to grow back in an area, meaning the user needs to explore a bit to keep their monsters healthy.
